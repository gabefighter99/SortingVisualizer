# SortingVisualizer

A fun project that visualizes (and audibilizes!) some popular sorting algorithms. Link:

Miscallaneous: 
* I almost blew an eardrum when I first added sound. Have since fixed the volume
* Spent way too long trying to figure out a parallelized Div-And-Conq algorithm implementation, but have since given up (damn single-threadedness. I dare you to say web workers)

Key takeaways: 
* There are some rly smart sorting algos out there
* Javascript is just dumb (for many reasons (like scope, there's rly no "Java" in javascript, type system (tf is wrong with built-in sort), single-threadedness))
* rendering differences between browsers is fascinatingly annoying.
