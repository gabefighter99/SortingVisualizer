# SortingVisualizer

A fun project that visualizes (and audibilizes!) some popular sorting algorithms. Link:

https://gabefighter99.github.io/SortingVisualizer/ (ignore the username, I was young)

Miscallaneous: 
* I almost blew an eardrum when I first added sound. Have since fixed the volume
* Spent way too long trying to figure out a parallelized Div-And-Conq algorithm implementation, but I settled for a visual trick (damn single-threadedness. I dare you to say web workers)

Key takeaways:
* Remembered some pretty cool algos
* Javascript is just dumb (for many reasons (like scope, there being rly no "Java" in javascript, the type system (tf is wrong with built-in sort), single-threadedness))
* rendering differences between browsers is fascinatingly annoying.
